This, as a dependency of xmake, contains files generated by xmake, which serves
as loop breaker of xmake.

Build without xmake:

0. Remember to install `libncurses-dev`
1. Run `xmake f --exception=y --small=n --menu`, unselect all packages and press save
2. `cp build/linux/x86_64/release/tbox.config.h debian/`
3. Run `xmake project -k cmake` and manually update `debian/CMakeLists.txt`
